Use of orientation/angles – Angles should be used, i.e. RPN should predict
5 parameters (including theta) instead of just 4. This would reduce certain
computations and would make learning easier for the RPN network.
The number of standard angles chosen. They can be increased/decreased
or changed. Currently, no optimum set of angles is found that is guaranteed
to provide good results.

Similarly, the aspect ratios and anchor scales can be changed and tested.
Lowering the number of ratios, would reduce the computation time, and
would also eliminate many unncessary boxes generated

Training on more images would improve the accuracy of the model. In the
current implementation training was done only on 50% of training data.

Image preprocessing is a crucial step. In our implementation, images are
resized to 800x800, and using the same downscaling ratio, the coordinates
of objects in the respective images are changed. This however, doesn’t
correctly scale the coordinates relative to the resized image. Certain error
terms can be introduced to tackle this.

All the images in the dataset are colored images (or multi-channel images).
And they have been used directly as it is. However, converting them into
grayscale would reduce the number of computation parameters by a great
deal. This won’t negatively affect the accuracy as well.
